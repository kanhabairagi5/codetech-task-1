A basic calculator in Java is a program that allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a common beginner project that helps to learn fundamental Java concepts like: 
Key Concepts:
User Input: The program takes input from the user, typically using the Scanner class, to get the numbers and the desired operation.
Arithmetic Operations: Java provides operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
Conditional Statements: if-else or switch-case statements are used to determine the operation to be performed based on the user's input.
Output: The program displays the result of the calculation to the user.
Implementation Approaches:
Using if-else:
This approach involves using if-else statements to check the operator entered by the user and perform the corresponding operation.
Using switch-case:
This approach provides a cleaner way to handle multiple cases (different operators) compared to if-else.
